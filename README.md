# 📚 Solidity Studies

Oi! This repo is my Solidity notebook, a personal collection of my early Solidity learning projects and notes when starting my journey into smart contract development. Everything here comes from my first months learning Solidity (before I touched Foundry or testing), so it’s pure contract logic and fundamentals.


## 📂 What’s inside

### **Simple Storage**
- `SimpleStorage.sol` — Basic storage contract.  
- `StorageFactory.sol` — A factory contract to deploy multiple SimpleStorage contracts.  

### **Fund Me**
- `FundMe.sol` — Complete “Fund Me” contract that uses a PriceConverter library to work with ETH/USD.  
- `PriceConverter.sol` — Utility library for price conversions.  

### **Learning Files**
- `1basics.sol` —  My go-to Solidity basics file:  
  - Variables & types  
  - Functions 
  - Structs, mappings  
  - Memory vs calldata vs storage  
  - Imports & interfaces  
  - Inheritance, override  
  - Events, modifiers, errors  

- `2FundMe.sol` — My step-by-step Fund Me contract with heavy comments explaining:
  - Constructor logic  
  - fallback & receive 
  - Gas optimization tips  
  - Withdraw patterns & security notes  


## Why I keep this here
Because when I was starting, **I needed everything in one place**. If I need to remind myself about something, the `1basics.sol` file feels like a dictionary, full of examples and comments that have been written.
